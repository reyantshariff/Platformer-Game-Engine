# OOGASalad Stand Up and Retrospective Discussion
### Platformers
### Logan Dracos, Danny Rod-flo, Reyan Shariff, Aaron Liao, Jack Regan, Christian Belper


## Project's current progress

We feel good about our backend and overall architecture, but otherwise we are behind. We have a good start
with implementing the platformers, but need to work on frontend/UI, the builder, git issues, and testing.

## Current level of communication

We are communicating often, but I think we are having more of an issue of understanding what has been done
and what is required of each of us by the end of the sprint. We are meeting twice a week while the whole
(or most of the) team, which feels about right if not a bit low. Once we understand what is required
of us for the given sprint, hopefully communication will follow.

## Satisfaction with team roles

As I mentioned above, the team roles have been too loosely defined. This is something we have been talking
about improving for sprint 3! (And we will)

## Teamwork that worked well

* Thing #1

The tuesday meetings were very helpful, having all 8 people together for an hour was great and the
coding session that night was also very productive. We are considering making it a weekly tradition.

* Thing #2

Our communication improved a lot this week. The planning week and sprint 1 were much quieter, which
was a problem, but now we are more vocally communicating across the tech stack.

## Teamwork that could be improved

* Thing #1

I think our team would benefit from some small meeting/coding sessions on more focused topics. For example,
the frontend group getting together separate of the rest of the squad.

* Thing #2

Maintaining better branch management, which is something we improved this week. Making sure to delete
branches that are no longer being used is a priority.
